### **Elections**

The members of the TSC can hold elections to vote for adding or removing members. 



### **Voting**

- The voting is based on a one-vote per voting member basis.
- To facilitate member voting, such as when casting votes for new committers and maintainers, a minimum of two votes (excluding the nominator's vote) will be necessary for the vote to be considered successful.



### **Term**

The term of the TSC membership is one year. Eligible for re-election after a new election.



### **Vacancies**

In the event of a resignation or other loss of an elected committee member, the next most preferred candidate from the previous election will be offered the seat.

A maximum of one (1) committee member may be selected this way between elections.

In case this fails to fill the seat, a special election for that position will be held as soon as possible.



### **Resignation**

If a committee member chooses not to continue in their role, for whatever self-elected reason, they must notify the committee in writing.



### **Removal**

A TSC member may be removed by an affirmative vote of a majority of the TSC.
