# StarRocks Community
[![Open Source Love](https://firstcontributions.github.io/open-source-badges/badges/open-source-v1/open-source.svg)](https://github.com/firstcontributions/open-source-badges)

Welcome to the StarRocks community! 
We're glad to have you here. This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the StarRocks community- improving docs, contributing code, giving talks, etc. 

Contributing to StarRocks
We want you to know that we accept different ways to contribute to StarRocks encompassing the following aspects:
- Community ‚Äì Active engagement with others, sharing insights, and knowledge.
- Vision ‚Äì A well-defined vision and consensus among contributors are essential.
- Documentation ‚Äì Proper documentation is crucial to ensure that ideas and processes are not confined to the minds of the authors alone.
- Code ‚Äì Meaningful discussions are supported and advanced through actual code contributions.
Once an individual has established a track record of quality contributions to StarRocks over a period of time, they are well on the way to maintainer-ship.

Valuable contributions in various aspects such as documentation, community work (including web development, build systems, event organization, and release management), and any devoted efforts are taken into account when considering someone for project involvement. Anyone who actively supports the community and contributes in any meaningful capacity has the potential to become a maintainer. In StarRocks, meritocracy is upheld, meaning individuals who have made significant contributions in any domain can be nominated and voted in as maintainers. Being a maintainer signifies a commitment to the project, not just limited to code commits.
As a general rule, it is encouraged to seek guidance from experts in specific areas until you gain sufficient expertise yourself. The voting process may vary based on your areas of influence, and it's possible to be voted into one project but not another depending on your contributions and expertise in respective fields.

Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to know more about how you can contribute.

## Governance
StarRocks has the following types of groups that are officially supported including the Technical Steering Committee and Special Interest Groups (SIGs):

### Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is a group responsible for providing overall leadership, strategic guidance, and decision-making authority to the project. The TSC also helps shape the project's roadmap and direction, ensures that it meets its goals, and facilitates collaboration within the community. 
See Technical Steering Committee for more details.

### Special Interest Groups (SIGs) 
SIGs play a crucial role in focusing on specific areas of expertise, functionality, or user needs. These groups allow contributors with shared interests to collaborate more effectively and contribute to the project's overall success. 
SIGs are established under the authority of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), which also designates the initial Maintainer or Maintainers. The SIG maintainer(s) possess the authority to nominate Committers, but these nominations must undergo approval via TSC voting before Committers are officially recognized within each SIG; for general SIG members, the SIG maintainers(s) or other active members may nominate you based on your contributions and dedication to the SIG's work. The nomination is usually followed by a formal membership vote within the SIG. If the vote is successful, you become an official member of the SIG. 

Each SIG's scope and members are recorded in its own document. The SIGs StarRocks currently have as below:
* SIG-Core 
* SIG-Documentation
* SIG-Testing
* SIG-Advocacy
